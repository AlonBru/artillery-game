# ðŸ’¥Untitled Artillery GameðŸ’¥
A small game based using webrtc with peerJs for peer-to-peer 2-player multiplayer.

The Project is deployed [here](https://alonbru.github.io/artillery-game/) for you to play with, though I'm afraid a friend to play with must be sourced locally.

## To develop locally
- clone this repo
- npm i
- npm run dev
